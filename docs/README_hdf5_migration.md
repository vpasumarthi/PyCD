## Technical Architecture

### HDF5 Schema Design
```
trajectory.h5
├── /metadata
│   ├── simulation_info (version, created_on, format_version)
│   ├── system_info (lattice_matrix, pbc, species_info)
│   └── simulation_params (time_interval, t_final, n_traj)
├── /trajectories
│   ├── traj_001
│   │   ├── coordinates (unwrapped, wrapped)
│   │   ├── time, energy, delg_0, potential
│   │   └── occupancy (optional)
│   └── ...
└── /analysis (optional, for future use)
```

### Dual-Writing Implementation
- **Configuration-driven**: YAML/CLI options to control format output
- **Parallel writing**: Simultaneous output to both `.npy` and HDF5 formats
- **Cross-validation**: Automated verification of data equivalence between formats
- **Performance monitoring**: Track overhead and optimize incrementally

### Key Technical Components
```python
# Core classes to be implemented
TrajectoryWriterConfig     # Format selection and configuration
TrajectoryWriterManager    # Coordinate writing across formats
HDF5TrajectoryWriter      # HDF5-specific implementation
NPYTrajectoryWriter       # Existing .npy functionality wrapper
TrajectoryValidator       # Cross-format validation
```
